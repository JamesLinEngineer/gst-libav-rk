The never-ending story of new features:
* add more codecs into our codec map
* demux/mux elements need rewrite for 0.9
* investigate possible use of AVFMT_FLAG_GENPTS for timestamp smoothing
* other filter elements that we don't have yet?
* can we wrap URLProtocol as a source/sink?

If you have cool ideas, add them here or contact the mailinglist:
