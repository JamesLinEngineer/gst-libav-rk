1.10 release series of your favourite cross-platform multimedia framework!


This release only contains bugfixes and it is safe to update from 1.10.x.

Other modules containing plugins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plugins
gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plugins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plugins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad

    rigorous quality testing we expect, or are still missing documentation
    and/or unit tests
